        "### Auction Contract\n",
        "Below is our implementation of a first price auction, which helps facilitate auctioning off an NFT. The auctioneer creates an auction by making an instance of the firstPriceAuction contract, inputting the auction duration, and information about the NFT being auctioned off. During the auction duration, bidders can call the bid() function, which stores their bids. The pay() function is callable after the auction has ended, and conducts the transaction between the auctioneer and the winner.\n",
